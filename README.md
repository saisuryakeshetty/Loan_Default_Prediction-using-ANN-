LendingClub is a US peer-to-peer lending company, headquartered in San Francisco, California. It was the first peer-to-peer lender to register its offerings as securities with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and to offer loan trading on a secondary market. LendingClub is the world's largest peer-to-peer lending platform.
Given historical data on loans given out with information on whether or not the borrower defaulted (charge-off), we wll build a model that can predict whether or nor a borrower will pay back their loan?
